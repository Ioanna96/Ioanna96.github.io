          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Nostos (from the ancient Greek word νέομαι/neomai, which means “to go or to come back”) refers to the return to one’s home. The concept of nostos was prevalent and introduced for the first time in Homer’s epic poem “Odyssey”, which remains one of the most important works in the Greek literary tradition. We decided to investigate the manifestations of this concept in Greek and Italian works of art, considering our own backgrounds and wishing to draw one more link between two cultures already strongly related. </p></div>

          <p>We decided that the concept of nostos occupied the central position in our idea, so we connected the related items and entities to it. The first diagram is the model that represents our idea in more specific terms. We decided to also create a more abstract version of it (see second diagram), in order to demonstrate that our general model can be applied in different contexts, as well. </p>

            <h2 id="theoretical">The Theoretical Model</h2>
          </div>
        </div>
          <p>In this part of the project, we are going to discuss briefly the questions we are going to address, in order to describe our items and clarify which of their aspects we are most interested in.The model is divided in four parts; WHO, which regards the people related to the items; WHAT, which refers to relevant concepts; WHEN, which concerns dates; and WHERE, which includes places.
</p>
    <p><u>WHO</u></p>
    <p>We are taking into consideration the people who are involved somehow in our core concept of νοστος, either as intellectuals whose work is centered around this concept or as subjects of works of art related to the concept. We are also interested in the people who made the items related to nostos available to the public in one way or another, mainly publishers and curators. Some of the creators are also subjects, thus we need to distinguish between the entity which creates from the entity which is represented. We also thought it would be useful to differentiate the people from the concepts functioning as subjects/topics. To address these points, we decided to use CIDOC-CRM and Dublin Core. Dublin Core terms were employed to show the different roles an agent can have (creator, subject, contributor) since CIDOC-CRM was not as specific in this aspect (in the role of, is about). It was adequate, though, to define the various roles, major events and references in works of art. 
</p>
    <p><u>WHAT</u></p>
    <p>This part of our theoretical model is essential. Our idea is centered around the core concept of nostos, so we need to properly address the question “What is the content of our objects?” Since we explore our idea in its manifestations in (Italian and Greek) works of art, we are also interested in the title and the type of representation of each object. With these aims in mind, we decided to use once more CIDOC-CRM to identify the topic and subtopics of our items. Dublin Core terms were also useful for this purpose, since they allowed us to specify even further the subtopics by classifying them as spatial, when a location was an important part of the content, or temporal, when a time period was a significant subtopic. Regarding representation, we used rdf:type, which could be reused for all of our entities, as we will demonstrate later. Finally, we chose rdfs:label to identify the title of the items, since the name provided was not always official, standard or provided by the creator. Therefore, we considered “label” to be a more appropriate predicate than “title”.

</p>
    <p><u>WHERE</u></p>
    <p>The aspect of location is secondary in our case, but still highly relevant to our idea. The most important question to address here is “Where was the item created?” since we are examining works of art in the Italian and Greek tradition. Moreover, due to the fact that we are dealing with works of art, it is worthwhile to mention the institution in which they are kept. For these purposes, we used Schema to specify the location where the items were created and CIDOC-CRM to state where the items are being held. When further describing each location, we used Geonames to provide the controlled name and the code of the countries.</p>
    <p><u>WHEN</u></p>
    <p>The aspect of time is the least relevant to our idea. In any case, it might be interesting to examine the period in which the works of art were created. Therefore, for our purposes, we consider the year and/or the time period of creation, when provided by the various institutions. We decided to use Schema to provide this information.

        </div>
        <p>The conceptual model is the application of our ideas on how to describe our items, as anticipated in the part of the theoretical model, by using, namely, CIDOC-CRM, DC terms, Geonames and Schema. </p>

          </div></div>
          <p>In this final part, we created two URIs for two central entities in our model: Odysseus and nostos. We decided to use Turtle to encode them, as it is a simple and quite popular language of the Semantic Web. Since we had been introduced to XML in class, we thought it might be a good idea to also get familiarized with Turtle.</p>

        <p>The work of Homer is fundamental in the investigation of the concept of nostos. Homer was the first one to describe with one word the idea of the journey back home, during which the hero has to overcome various obstacles. The epic poem is among the most important works to have survived antiquity and remains an important part of the Greek cultural heritage. We decided to use a random edition of Homer’s Odyssey located in the British Library.</p>

         <p>The bowl depicts a scene from Odyssey, namely the encounter of Odysseus with Circe. The enchantress Circe is one of the numerous obstacles Odysseus has to overcome, in order to return to Ithaca. The item is held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The institution does not state whether a specific standard was being followed when describing the item, thus we had, once more, to compare the description with various standards. </p><p>
We could discern that most of the elements could be originating from CDWA. Since these categories were also used before, we will only mention them here: <br>Period (4.4.), Date (4.2.), Culture (4.4.), Dimensions (6.1), Classification (Object type 1.2.), Credit Line (Ownership history 23.), Location/Department (21.1), Materials (7.1.). In this case, there is also the mention of the possible creator, which is covered by the category 4.1 Creator Descriptions. CDWA accounts for uncertainty in the identification of the creator, which is very useful here: the item is “attributed to the Persephone Painter”.</p>

         <p>Foscolo's collection of poems, and especially the poem <i> Zacinto</i>, is related to our core concept. In his <i> Zacinto </i> Foscolo mentions Odyssey and speaks of exile. The item could be found only as part of editions containing other works of the author. We chose an edition within the Opac catalogue.</p> <p>The library object is described with ISBD and Marc 21. It is worth-mentioning that unimarc is employed for the authority control of the name of the author.</p>

        <p>The ISBD description deals with 5 of the 9 areas provided by the standard:</p>
<ul><li>Area 1: Title and statement of responsibility </li>
<li>Area 4: Publication, production and distribution</li>
<li>Area 5: Material description of the item</li>
<li>Area 6: Series area</li>
<li>Area 8: Resource identifier</li> </ul>
<p>Some of the information that is missing can be found in the labels present under the ISBD cataloging, regarding the type of edition and document and the language. Furthermore, there is an additional resource identifier that follows the ICCU standard.  </p>

<p>The Marc 21 description provides similar information with the addition of the authority name record for the author:</p>

<ul><li>LEADER → Leader element,it states the record length,the type of record and the bibliographic level.</li>
<li>001 →  control number ( Italy/Istituto centrale per il catalogo unico/control number)</li>

<li>005 →    date and time of latest transaction </li>

<li>024  →   other standard identifier</li>

        <div class="modal-body">
         <p>This item is a movie, held in the Rosebud Cinema Archive of Reggio Emilia. It follows the adventures of Odysseus during his trip back to Ithaca.</p> <p>Unfortunately this archive doesn’t follow a clear standard and for this item there are few information, displayed in a unclear way. In fact, all the people that have worked in the project are grouped together under the cast and credits label, with the exception of the director. 
The comment section is the only one that goes deep in the topic, giving an explanation and a point of view from which to examine the message of the movie. 
It can be said that the few labels present follow, more or less, the dublin core standard for the notions of title, creator (the director) and description (the plot).

        <p>The bust represents the portrait of Virgil, the author of Eneid, which is rather central in our idea of connecting the Italian and Greek tradition on the basis of the concept of nostos.

</a></h4>

        <div class="modal-body">
         <p>Eneide is the famous epic poem written by Virgil and remains to our day one of the most important works of the Italian culture. It follows the adventures of Enea, after the loss of his home. In one sense, nostos is impossible for him and we thought this was an importan aspect to be taken into consideration; the other side of the coin. Since returning home is not an option for him after Troy was destroyed, his search for a new place to call home is an interesting and different take on nostos. In this case, nostos acquires a new dimension: the trip towards a home that has not been found yet. We decided to include a manuscript of the story. This item is one of the oldest representation we have left of this poem. It is held in the Vatican library and it is catalogued under the name Vaticano latino 3867. </p> 
        <p>This institution states of cataloguing its items through the Marcand ISBD standard, but for this item it was only possible to examine a catalographic description, online or in a pdf format, that, doesn’t follow clearly those standard. Anyway, many of the labels can be aligned with the Marc standard as can be seen in the metadata alignment section of the project.</p>
<p>In particular the labels can be aligned in this way:<br>
The title (ocelli nominum) can be considered as Marc 245;<br>
The language label can be referred as part of Marc 008;<br>
The description section about topic and content and the type of media can fall under  Marc 650, 336 and 337;<br>
The information presented about the creation period and place can be aligned with Marc 008 and 260 that refer to the publishing date and place;<br>
Finally the place where the item is held nowadays can be stated with Marc 852.
